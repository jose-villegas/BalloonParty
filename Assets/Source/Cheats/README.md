# Cheats

Runtime cheat console for testing and debugging without modifying game state manually.

Toggle the console window in Play Mode with the **backtick** (`` ` ``) key, or — on touch devices — a **3-finger tap** (three simultaneous touches; fires once on the rising edge, so it can't retrigger while held). The 3-finger tap only registers in a build that compiles the cheat system in — a **development build**, or a release build made with cheats enabled (see below) — and legacy `Input.touchCount` reads 0 in the editor Game view. The console GameObject is created automatically at runtime — no scene setup required. The console discovers all registered cheats automatically and organises them by section and tag.

## In-game log console (on-device logs)

`Debug.Log` output isn't visible on a device without a wired-up console. The project depends on yasirkula's [In-game Debug Console](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityIngameDebugConsole) (`com.yasirkula.ingamedebugconsole`, a UPM git dependency in `Packages/manifest.json`) for this.

`DevLogConsole` (a `MonoBehaviour`) spawns the console prefab at startup and `DontDestroyOnLoad`s it — **mobile development builds only** (plus mobile release builds made with `CHEATS_IN_RELEASE`). Its guard, `UNITY_EDITOR || ((DEVELOPMENT_BUILD || CHEATS_IN_RELEASE) && (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS))`, keeps the component wireable in the editor but strips it from desktop dev builds and ordinary release builds (the serialized prefab reference goes with it, so the console never ships there). At runtime it no-ops in the editor (the editor has its own Console window). Place one `DevLogConsole` in the **Launch scene** and assign the package's `IngameDebugConsole` prefab to its field.

## Build visibility

The entire `Cheats/` system — console, `ICheat`, and all cheat implementations — is wrapped in `#if UNITY_EDITOR || DEVELOPMENT_BUILD || CHEATS_IN_RELEASE`. It compiles out completely in ordinary release builds. Registration in `GameLifetimeScope` and the `CheatState` checks sprinkled through gameplay controllers are guarded by the same directive.

### Release builds with cheats (`CHEATS_IN_RELEASE`)

**Tools → BalloonParty → Cheats In Release Builds** toggles the `CHEATS_IN_RELEASE` scripting define on the active build target (checkmark shows current state). While on, a normal release build includes the full cheat system — without paying the other development-build costs (`Log.Info`/`Log.Assert` stay stripped, no dev-build profiler/overlay overhead), so the build stays performance-representative. The define lives in ProjectSettings and **persists until toggled off** — turn it off before building anything meant to ship (the enable path logs a warning as a reminder).

## VContainer registration

`CheatConsoleView`, `BalloonRemoverCheat`, `DisturbanceStampCheat`, and `LightStampCheat` are MonoBehaviours created via `RegisterComponentOnNewGameObject`. VContainer singletons are **lazy** — the GameObject is only created when resolved. Each requires `RegisterBuildCallback(resolver => resolver.Resolve<T>())` to force eager creation at scope build time.

## Adding a new cheat

1. Create a class implementing `ICheat` — give it a `Name`, a `Section`, and one or more `Tags`.
2. Inject whatever publishers or services it needs via the constructor.
3. Register it in `GameLifetimeScope`:
   ```csharp
   builder.Register<YourCheat>(Lifetime.Singleton).AsImplementedInterfaces();
   ```
That's all. The console picks it up automatically.

### Interactive cheats

A cheat that needs inputs (dropdowns, counters) also implements `ICheatControls.DrawControls()`. The console draws that IMGUI block in the cheat's row (below a plain name + ☆ header) instead of the one-shot Execute button — `SpawnBalloonCheat` is the reference. `DrawControls` is only ever called from within `OnGUI`. `Execute()` is still required by `ICheat`; make it perform the same action with the current selections so the cheat also works if surfaced as a plain button.

## Console features

- **Search** — filters cheats by name as you type
- **Tag pills** — click a tag to filter to only cheats with that tag; click again or "All" to clear
- **Sections** — cheats are grouped by their `Section` property
- **Favorites** — click ☆ next to any cheat to pin it to the top of the list
- **Thrower held while open** — opening the console `Pause`s `PauseSource.Cheat` (releases on close/teardown), so the thrower stays inert and stray fires don't disturb testing

## Current cheats

| Name | Section | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Spawn Balloon Line | Spawning | Publishes `SpawnBalloonLineMessage` — spawns one new row of balloons |
| Spawn Balloon | Spawning | Pick a `BalloonType`, an item to hold (or None), and a count; force-spawns that many into open slots (bottom-up), assigning the item to each that can hold one. Bypasses the weighted spawner + caps by design. An interactive cheat (`ICheatControls`) — draws its own type/item grids + count stepper |
| Remove Balloons | Grid | Draw across balloons to remove them and trigger a balance pass |
| Add Shields | Projectile | Adds shields to the shot currently loaded in the thrower — bumps the reactive count directly, so the shield view plays its normal gain feedback. Interactive: draws an amount stepper |
| Fire Best Shot | Projectile | Sweeps the shot solver across the aim arc and fires the best-scoring angle through `ThrowerController.FireAt` — the Shot Solver window's "Fire Best" as a one-tap cheat, usable on device |
| Trigger Level Up | Score | Fills all color bars to the current threshold and immediately triggers the level-up ceremony |
| Near Level Up | Score | Fills all color bars to one point below the threshold — pop one balloon of each color to complete the level naturally |
| Award Score Pop | Score | Awards one N-point pop of a chosen colour through the real hit pipeline (streak reset first so it lands on exactly N) — the way to summon any BigScore catalog shape on demand. Interactive: point field, colour cycle button, and preset buttons per catalog denomination |
| Level Lock | Score | Toggle — locks the current level: score trails still fly on a pop but nothing sticks (`ClaimProgress` grants the visual only; both `OnTrailArrived` handlers skip their commit, so score/bars stay put), no level-up cinematic/ceremony can start (`WillLevelUp`/`CheckLevelUp` guarded), `PlayerHealthController.Damage` no-ops (hearts never drain), and `RunController.EndRun` no-ops (no loss). Sit on a level indefinitely to test it; toggle off to resume normal play. Sets the dev-only `CheatState.BlockLevelUp` flag |
| Force Game Over | Run | Calls `RunController.EndRun()` — commits the run and shows the GameOver screen |
| Restart Run | Run | Calls `RunController.RestartRun()` — resets every `IRunResettable` and returns to `Game` |
| Start From Level | Run | Sets the dev start-level override then restarts the run so it begins at the chosen level — the in-play equivalent of the Level Pacing window's "play from here" |
| Stamp Disturbance | Grid | Toggle on, then mouse-drag to stamp disturbances into the shared disturbance field. Uses `DisturbanceFieldService.Stamp()` at the mouse world position with drag direction |
| Place Light | Lighting | Toggle on, pick a palette colour from the dropdown, then tap the board to drop a light into the shared light field there; "Clear" removes every light placed so far |
