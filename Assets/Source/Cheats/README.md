# Cheats

Runtime cheat console for testing and debugging without modifying game state manually.

Toggle the console window in Play Mode with the **backtick** (`` ` ``) key, or — on touch devices — a **3-finger tap** (three simultaneous touches; fires once on the rising edge, so it can't retrigger while held). The 3-finger tap only registers in a **development build** (or via Unity Remote): the whole cheat system compiles out otherwise (see below), and legacy `Input.touchCount` reads 0 in the editor Game view. The console GameObject is created automatically at runtime — no scene setup required. The console discovers all registered cheats automatically and organises them by section and tag.

## Build visibility

The entire `Cheats/` system — console, `ICheat`, and all cheat implementations — is wrapped in `#if UNITY_EDITOR || DEVELOPMENT_BUILD`. It compiles out completely in release builds. Registration in `GameLifetimeScope` is guarded by the same directive.

## VContainer registration

`CheatConsoleView`, `BalloonRemoverCheat`, and `DisturbanceStampCheat` are MonoBehaviours created via `RegisterComponentOnNewGameObject`. VContainer singletons are **lazy** — the GameObject is only created when resolved. Each requires `RegisterBuildCallback(resolver => resolver.Resolve<T>())` to force eager creation at scope build time.

## Adding a new cheat

1. Create a class implementing `ICheat` — give it a `Name`, a `Section`, and one or more `Tags`.
2. Inject whatever publishers or services it needs via the constructor.
3. Register it in `GameLifetimeScope`:
   ```csharp
   builder.Register<YourCheat>(Lifetime.Singleton).AsImplementedInterfaces();
   ```
That's all. The console picks it up automatically.

### Interactive cheats

A cheat that needs inputs (dropdowns, counters) also implements `ICheatControls.DrawControls()`. The console draws that IMGUI block in the cheat's row (below a plain name + ☆ header) instead of the one-shot Execute button — `SpawnBalloonCheat` is the reference. `DrawControls` is only ever called from within `OnGUI`. `Execute()` is still required by `ICheat`; make it perform the same action with the current selections so the cheat also works if surfaced as a plain button.

## Console features

- **Search** — filters cheats by name as you type
- **Tag pills** — click a tag to filter to only cheats with that tag; click again or "All" to clear
- **Sections** — cheats are grouped by their `Section` property
- **Favorites** — click ☆ next to any cheat to pin it to the top of the list
- **Thrower held while open** — opening the console `Pause`s `PauseSource.Cheat` (releases on close/teardown), so the thrower stays inert and stray fires don't disturb testing

## Current cheats

| Name | Section | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Spawn Balloon Line | Spawning | Publishes `SpawnBalloonLineMessage` — spawns one new row of balloons |
| Spawn Balloon | Spawning | Pick a `BalloonType`, an item to hold (or None), and a count; force-spawns that many into open slots (bottom-up), assigning the item to each that can hold one. Bypasses the weighted spawner + caps by design. An interactive cheat (`ICheatControls`) — draws its own type/item grids + count stepper |
| Remove Balloons | Grid | Draw across balloons to remove them and trigger a balance pass |
| Trigger Level Up | Score | Fills all color bars to the current threshold and immediately triggers the level-up ceremony |
| Near Level Up | Score | Fills all color bars to one point below the threshold — pop one balloon of each color to complete the level naturally |
| Force Game Over | Run | Calls `RunController.EndRun()` — commits the run and shows the GameOver screen |
| Restart Run | Run | Calls `RunController.RestartRun()` — resets every `IRunResettable` and returns to `Game` |
| Stamp Disturbance | Grid | Toggle on, then mouse-drag to stamp disturbances into the shared disturbance field. Uses `DisturbanceFieldService.Stamp()` at the mouse world position with drag direction |
